## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A2: Aquatic and Hydrological Applications

Earth Engine’s global scope and long time series allow analysts to understand the water cycle in new and unique ways. These include surface water in the form of floods and river characteristics, long-term issues of water balance, and the detection of subsurface ground water.

# Chapter A2.2: Benthic Habitats

## Authors:
Dimitris Poursanidis, Aurélie C. Shapiro, Spyros Christofilakos



## Overview 
Shallow-water coastal benthic habitats, which can comprise seagrasses, sandy soft bottoms, and coral reefs, are essential ecosystems, supporting fisheries, providing coastal protection, and sequestering “blue” carbon. Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with blue and green spectral bands, can penetrate clear, shallow water, allowing us to identify what lies on the seafloor. In terrestrial habitats, atmospheric and topographic corrections are important, whereas in shallow waters, it is essential to correct the effects of the water column, as different depths can change the reflectance observed by the satellite sensor. Once you know water depth, you can accurately assess benthic habitats such as seagrass, sand, and coral. In this chapter, we will describe how to estimate water depth from high-resolution Planet data and map benthic habitats.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Separating land from water with a supervised classification.
 - Identifying and classifying benthic habitats using machine learning.
 - Removing surface sunglint and wave glint.
 - Developing regression models to estimate water depth using training data.
 - Correcting for water depth to derive bottom surface reflectance through a regression approach.
 - Evaluating training data and model accuracy.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

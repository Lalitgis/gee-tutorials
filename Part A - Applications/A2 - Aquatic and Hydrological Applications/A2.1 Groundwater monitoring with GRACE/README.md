## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A2: Aquatic and Hydrological Applications

Earth Engine’s global scope and long time series allow analysts to understand the water cycle in new and unique ways. These include surface water in the form of floods and river characteristics, long-term issues of water balance, and the detection of subsurface ground water.


# Chapter A2.1: Groundwater Monitoring with GRACE

## Authors
A.J. Purdy, J.S. Famiglietti


## Overview
The following tutorial details how to use observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to evaluate changes in groundwater storage for a large river basin. Here, you will learn how to apply remote sensing estimates of total water storage anomalies, land surface model output, and in situ observations to resolve groundwater storage changes in California’s Central Valley. The following method has been applied to study water storage changes around the world, and can be ported to quantify groundwater storage change for major river basins.  


## Learning Outcomes
 - Plotting changes in total water storage using GRACE.
 - Mapping trends in water storage.
 - Resolving changes in groundwater storage for a river basin.
 - Import image collections and create image collections from assets.
 - Create charts by reducing an ImageCollection with a feature geometry.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

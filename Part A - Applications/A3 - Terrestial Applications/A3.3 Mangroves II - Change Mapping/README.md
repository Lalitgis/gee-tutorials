## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.

# Chapter A3.3: Mangroves II - Change Mapping

## Authors
Celio de Sousa, David Lagomasino, and Lola Fatoyinbo




## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to present two methods of land cover extent change detection: map-to-map and map-to-image using anomaly data. In a map-to-map approach, changes are extracted by subtracting a two-date pair of land cover extent maps: that is, time 2 (T2) extent minus time 1 (T1) extent. By comparison, a map-to-image approach uses a baseline extent map within which changes are calculated based on a T2 image where the change classes are defined by threshold values. In this lab, we will perform a map-to-map change detection between two mangrove extent maps from 2000 and 2020, and also perform a vegetation index anomaly analysis to detect changes within a mangrove extent map from the year 2000 in Guinea, West Africa.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Performing change detection by contrasting two preexistent mangrove extent maps.
 - Harmonizing across Landsat generations to create consistent long-term series
 - Calculating the anomaly of a given vegetation index based on its long-term average value.
 - Performing change detection by interpreting vegetation index anomalies

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.

# Chapter A3.2: Mangroves

## Author
Aurélie Shapiro




## Overview
Mangrove ecosystems are tropical coastal forests that are adapted to saltwater environments. Their unique qualities of existing primarily in moist environments at low elevation along shorelines, lack of seasonality, and compact pattern make them relatively easy to identify in satellite images. In this chapter we present a series of automated steps, including water masking, to extract mangroves from a fusion of optical and active radar data. Furthermore, as global mangrove datasets are readily available in Google Earth Engine, we present an approach to automatically extract training data from existing information, saving time and effort in your supervised classification. The method can then be adapted to create subsequent maps from your own results to produce changes in mangrove ecosystems over time.    


## Learning Outcomes
 - Fusing Sentinel-1 and -2 optical/radar sensors.
 - Sampling points on an image to create training and testing datasets.
 - Calculating additional indices to add to the image stack.
 - Applying an automatic water masking function and buffering to focus classification on coastal areas likely to have mangroves.
 - Understanding supervised classification with random forests using automatically derived training data.
 - Evaluating training and model accuracy.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

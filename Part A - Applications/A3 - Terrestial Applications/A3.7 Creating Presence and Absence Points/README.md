## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.

# Chapter A3.7: Creating Presence and Absence Points

## Authors
Peder Engelstad, Daniel Carver, Nicholas E. Young



## Overview 
The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate a method to generate your own presence and absence data and distribute those samples using specific ecological characteristics found in remotely sensed imagery. You will see that even when field data is unavailable, you can still digitally sample a landscape and gather information on current or past ecological conditions.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Generating presence and absence data manually using high-resolution imagery.
 - Generating randomly distributed points automatically within a feature class layer to use as field sampling locations.
 - Filtering your points to refine your sampling locations.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.

# Chapter A3.4: Forest Degradation and Deforestation

## Authors
Carlos Souza Jr., Karis Tenneson, John Dilger, Crystal Wespestad, Eric Bullock



## Overview
Tropical forests are being disturbed by deforestation and forest degradation at an unprecedented pace (Hansen et al. 2013, Bullock et al. 2020). Deforestation completely removes the original forest cover and replaces it with another land cover type, such as pasture or agriculture fields. Generally speaking, forest degradation is a temporary or permanent disturbance, often caused by predatory logging, fires, or forest fragmentation, where the tree loss does not entirely change the land cover type. Forest degradation leads to a more complex environment with a mixture of vegetation, soil, tree trunks and branches, and fire ash. Defining a boundary between deforestation and forest degradation is not straightforward; at the time this chapter was written, there was no universally accepted definition for forest degradation (Aryal et al. 2021). Furthermore, the signal of forest degradation often disappears within one to two years, making degraded forests spectrally similar to undisturbed forests. Due to these factors, detecting and mapping forest degradation with remotely sensed optical data is more challenging than mapping deforestation.


The purpose of this chapter is to present a spectral unmixing algorithm and the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) to detect and map both forest degradation and deforestation in tropical forests. This spectral unmixing model uses a set of generic endmembers (Souza et al. 2005a) to process any Landsat Surface Reflectance (Tier 1) scene available in Google Earth Engine. We present two examples of change detection applications, one comparing a pair of images acquired at different times a year apart by making a temporal color composite and an empirically defined change threshold, and another using a more extensive and dense time series approach.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Calculating NDFI, the Normalized Difference Fraction Index
 - Interpreting fraction images and NDFI using a temporal color composite.
 - Analyzing deforestation and forest degradation with NDFI
 - Running a time-series change detection to detect forest change.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.


# Chapter A3.1: Active fire monitoring

## Authors
Morgan A. Crowley* and Tianjia Liu* (*shared first-authorship)



## Overview
Fire monitoring across the world benefits from raw satellite imagery and processed fire-mapping datasets. Google Earth Engine supports fire monitoring throughout fire seasons with satellite data from sources like Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and by hosting multiple fire datasets from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). In this chapter, you will access, process, and explore three fire monitoring datasets available in the data catalog. By the end of this chapter, you will learn how to use the Code Editor and user apps to summarize and compare the characteristics of fires, fire seasons, and fire-monitoring datasets.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Accessing and visualizing fire-monitoring datasets in the JavaScript UI.
 - Adjusting previously drafted code to calculate fire characteristics in the JavaScript UI for a fire of your choice.
 - Exploring fire metrics and visualization with user apps.
 - Identifying pros and cons of different fire datasets for a variety of monitoring objectives.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

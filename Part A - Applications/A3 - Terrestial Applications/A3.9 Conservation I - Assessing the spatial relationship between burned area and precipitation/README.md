## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.

# Chapter A3.9: Conservation Applications - Assessing the spatial relationship between burned area and precipitation

## Authors
Harriet Branson and Chelsea Smith



## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the need for fire and rainfall trend monitoring to inform conservation management practices.

Practical conservation requires an understanding of key environmental factors such as fire and rainfall, which impact the amount of forage and habitat available for a variety of species. This chapter will guide you through how to create fire and rainfall time series and visualize this data. At the end of this chapter, you will be able to present this information in an accessible way on a graph to help inform conservation management practices such as early burning and supplementary feeding.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding why fire and rainfall trends are useful in conservation management.
 - Creating a time series of burned areas.  
 - Writing a function to map areal mean rainfall calculations over an ImageCollection.
 - Generating an interactive graph displaying fire and rainfall trends over a 10-year period.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A3: Terrestrial Applications

Earth’s terrestrial surface is analyzed regularly by satellites, in search of both change and stability. These are of great interest to a wide cross-section of Earth Engine users, and projects across large areas illustrate both the challenges and opportunities for life on Earth. Chapters in this Part illustrate the use of Earth Engine for disturbance, understanding long-term changes of rangelands, and creating optimum study sites.


# Chapter A3.6: Working With GPS and Weather Data

## Authors
Peder Engelstad, Daniel Carver, Nicholas E. Young



## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how to use Google Earth Engine as a means of associating remotely sensed data (weather observations) with open-source GPS point locations. These methods will provide a quick and easy way to access and analyze large amounts of information relative to your own research and efficiently move your data outside Earth Engine.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Pairing values from remotely sensed data with uploaded data.
 - Exporting features from Earth Engine.

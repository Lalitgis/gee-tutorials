## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.


# Chapter A1.2: Urban Environments

## Authors
Michelle Stuhlmacher and Ran Goldblatt



## Overview
Urbanization has dramatically changed Earth’s surface. This chapter starts with a qualitative look at the impact urban expansion has on the landscape, covering three existing urban classification schemes that have been created by other remote sensing scientists. We look at how these classifications can be used to quantify urban areas, and close with instructions on how to perform per-pixel supervised image classification to map built-up land cover at any location on Earth and at any point in time using Landsat 7 imagery.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Creating an animated GIF.
 - Implementing quantitative and qualitative analyses with pre-existing urban classifications.
 - Running your own classification of built-up land cover.
 - Quantifying and mapping the extent of urbanization across space and time.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.

# Chapter A1.7: Humanitarian Applications

## Authors
Jamon Van Den Hoek and Hannah K. Friedrich



## Overview
The global refugee population has never been as large as it is today, with at least 26 million refugees living in more than 100 countries. Refugees are international migrants who have been forcibly displaced from their home countries due to violence or persecution and who cross an international border and settle elsewhere, most often in a neighboring country. Remote sensing can help refugee leaders, humanitarian agencies, and refugee-hosting countries gain new insights into refugee settlement, population, and land cover change dynamics (Maystadt et al. 2020, Van Den Hoek et al. 2021). In this chapter, we will examine the value of using satellite imagery and satellite-derived data to map a refugee settlement in Uganda, estimate its population, and gauge land cover changes in and around the settlement.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Using a range of techniques—maps, videos, and charts—to visualize and measure land cover changes before and after the establishment of a refugee settlement.
 - Understanding the considerations and limitations involved in automated detection of refugee settlement boundaries using unsupervised classification.
 - Becoming familiar with satellite-derived human settlement and population datasets and their application in a refugee settlement context.

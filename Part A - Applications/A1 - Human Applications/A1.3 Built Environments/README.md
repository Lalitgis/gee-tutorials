## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.


# Chapter A1.3: Built Environments

## Author 
Erin Trochim



## Overview
The built environment consists of the human-made physical parts of the environment, including homes, buildings, streets, open spaces, and infrastructure. This chapter will focus on analyzing global infrastructure datasets.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Quantifying road characteristics.
 - Comparing road and transmission line distributions.
 - Contrasting changes in impervious surfaces with flooding.
 - Understanding vector-based versus raster-based approaches.

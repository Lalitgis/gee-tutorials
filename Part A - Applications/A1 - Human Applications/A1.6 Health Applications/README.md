## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.

# Chapter A1.6: Health Applications

## Author
Dawn Nekorchuk



## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how Google Earth Engine may be used to support modeling and forecasting of vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria. In doing so, the chapter will also show how Earth Engine may be used to gather data for subsequent analyses outside of Earth Engine, the results of which can then also be brought back into Earth Engine.


We will be calculating and exporting data of remotely-sensed environmental variables: precipitation, temperature, and a vegetation water index. These factors can impact mosquito life cycles, malaria parasites, and transmission dynamics. These data can then be used in R for modeling and forecasting malaria in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, using the Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) system, developed by the EcoGRAPH research group at the University of Oklahoma.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Extracting and calculating malaria-relevant variables from existing data sets: precipitation, temperature, and wetness.
 - Importing satellite data and filtering for images over a region and time period.
 - Joining two data products to get additional quality information.
 - Computing zonal summaries of the calculated variables for elements in a FeatureCollection.

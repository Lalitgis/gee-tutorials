## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.

# Chapter A1.1: Agricultural Environments

## Authors 
Sherrie Wang and George Azzari



## Overview

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce how datasets and functions available in Earth Engine can be used to map agriculture at scale. We will walk through an example of mapping crop types in the US Midwest, which is one of the main breadbaskets of the world. The skills learned in this chapter will equip you to go on to map other agricultural characteristics, such as yields and management practices.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Classifying crop type in a county in the US Midwest using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) as labels.
 - Using ee.Reducer.linearRegression to fit a second-order harmonic regression to a crop time series and extract harmonic coefficients.
 - Using the Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI) for crop type classification.
 - Training a random forest to classify crop type from harmonic coefficients.
 - Applying the trained random forest classifier to the study region and assessing its performance.

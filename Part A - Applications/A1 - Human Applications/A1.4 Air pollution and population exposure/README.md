## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.

# Chapter A1.4: Air Pollution and Population Exposure

## Authors
Zander Venter and Sourangsu Chowdhury



## Overview
After high blood pressure and smoking, air pollution is the third-largest risk factor for death globally (Murray et al. 2020). Air pollution can therefore be described as a global “pandemic” that should arguably be monitored and addressed with the same intensity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has been. Remote sensing and cloud computing technologies allow us to do so.


The purpose of this chapter is to explore and analyze gridded air pollution data from Sentinel-5P in the context of changes brought about by COVID-19 lockdowns. Practical components will include analyzing changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over time and quantifying population-weighted NO2 concentrations for selected administrative units.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding Sentinel-5P data.
 - Quantifying changes in air pollutant concentrations over time.
 - Generating a split-panel map to compare two time epochs.
 - Calculating population-weighted air pollutant concentrations.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

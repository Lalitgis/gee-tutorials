## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part A1: Human Applications

This Part covers some of the many Human Applications of Earth Engine. It includes demonstrations of how Earth Engine can be used in agricultural and urban settings, including for sensing the built environment and the effects it has on air composition and temperature. This Part also covers the complex topics of human health, illicit deforestation activity, and humanitarian actions.


# Chapter A1.8: Monitoring Gold Mining Activity Using SAR

## Authors
Lucio Villa, Sidney Novoa, Milagros Becerra, Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, Karen Dyson, Karis Tenneson, John Dilger



## Overview
The expansion of gold mining has had a large impact on the rainforests of the Amazon over the last decades. To take just one example, it has affected both the biodiversity and the lives of local people in the Madre de Dios region of southeastern Peru. In this chapter, we will review a methodology developed to generate early warnings of deforestation based on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, we will identify the Sentinel-1 images suitable for the construction of a time series of preprocessed datasets. Second, we will run a change detection analysis based on a statistical analysis of the Sentinel-1 images (Canty et al. 2019). Finally, we will show the steps to follow in the post-processing stage by filtering information with forest / non-forest and bodies of water datasets.

## Learning Outcomes
 - Selecting and creating a multitemporal SAR mosaic.
 - Generating SAR change detection based on a statistical analysis of Sentinel-1 images.
 - Post-processing of alerts generated by filtering maximum area patches and information of forest/non-forest and water bodies.

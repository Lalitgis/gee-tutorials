## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.7: Interpreting Time Series with CCDC
## Authors 
Paulo Arévalo, Pontus Olofsson



# Overview
Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) is a land change monitoring algorithm designed to operate on time series of satellite data, particularly Landsat data. This chapter focuses on the portion that is the change detection component (CCD); you will learn how to run the algorithm, interpret its outputs, and visualize coefficients and change information.

# Learning Outcomes
 - Exploring pixel-level time series of Landsat observations, as well as the temporal segments that CCDC fits to the observations.
 - Visualizing the coefficients of the temporal segments in space.
 - Visualizing predicted images made from detected temporal segments.
 - Visualizing change information.
 - Using array image functions.
 - Attaching user-defined metadata to an image when exporting.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

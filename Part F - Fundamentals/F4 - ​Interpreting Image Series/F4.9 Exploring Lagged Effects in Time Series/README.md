## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.9: Exploring Lagged Effects in Time Series 
## Authors
Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, Karen Dyson, David Saah, Nicholas Clinton



## Overview
In this chapter, we will introduce lagged effects to build on previous work in modeling time-series data. Time-lagged effects occur when an event at one point in time impacts dependent variables at a later point in time. You will be introduced to concepts of autocovariance and autocorrelation, cross-covariance and cross-correlation, and auto-regressive models. At the end of this chapter, you will be able to examine how variables relate to one another across time, and to fit time series models that take into account lagged events. 


## Learning Outcomes
 - Using the ee.Join function to create time-lagged collections.
 - Calculating autocovariance and autocorrelation.
 - Calculating cross-covariance and cross-correlation.
 - Fitting auto-regressive models.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

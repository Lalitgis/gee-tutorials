## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.3: Clouds and Image Compositing
## Authors:
Txomin Hermosilla, Saverio Francini, Andréa P. Nicolau, Michael A. Wulder, Joanne C. White, Nicholas C. Coops, Gherardo Chirici



## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to provide necessary context and demonstrate different approaches for image composite generation when using data quality flags, using an initial example of removing cloud cover. We will examine different filtering options, demonstrate an approach for cloud masking, and provide additional opportunities for image composite development. Pixel selection for composite development can exclude unwanted pixels—such as those impacted by cloud, shadow, and smoke or haze—and can also preferentially select pixels based upon proximity to a target date or a preferred sensor type.  


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding and applying satellite-specific cloud mask functions.
 - Incorporating images from different sensors.
 - Using focal functions to fill in data gaps.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

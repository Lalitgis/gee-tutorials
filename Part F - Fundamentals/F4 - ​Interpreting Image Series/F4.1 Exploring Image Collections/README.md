## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.1: Exploring Image Collections
## Author
Gennadii Donchyts


## Overview
This chapter teaches how to explore image collections, including their spatiotemporal extent, resolution, and values stored in images and image properties. You will learn how to map and inspect image collections using maps, charts, and interactive tools, and how to compute different statistics of values stored in image collections using reducers.


## Learning Outcomes 
 - Inspecting the spatiotemporal extent and resolution of image collections by mapping image geometry and plotting image time properties.
 - Exploring properties of images stored in an ImageCollection by plotting charts and deriving statistics.
 - Filtering image collections by using stored or computed image properties.
 - Exploring the distribution of values stored in image pixels of an ImageCollection through percentile reducers.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

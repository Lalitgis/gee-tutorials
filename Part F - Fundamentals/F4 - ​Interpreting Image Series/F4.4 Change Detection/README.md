## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.4: Change Detection

## Authors
Karis Tenneson, John Dilger, Crystal Wespestad, Brian Zutta, Andréa P Nicolau, Karen Dyson, Paula Paz


## Overview
This chapter introduces change detection mapping. It will teach you how to make a two-date land cover change map using image differencing and threshold-based classification. You will use what you have learned so far in this book to produce a map highlighting changes in the land cover between two time steps. You will first explore differences between the two images extracted from these time steps by creating a difference layer. You will then learn how to directly classify change based on the information in both of your images.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Creating and exploring how to read a false-color cloud-free Landsat composite image
 - Calculating the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index.  
 - Creating a two-image difference to help locate areas of change.
 - Producing a change map and classifying changes using thresholding.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F4: Interpreting Image Series

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download all the data to a local disk for processing. Because remote-sensing data files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades.

# Chapter F4.5: Interpreting Annual Time Series with LandTrendr
## Authors
Robert Kennedy, Justin Braaten, Peter Clary



## Overview
Time-series analysis of change can be achieved by fitting the entire spectral trajectory using simple statistical models. These allow us to both simplify the time series and to extract useful information about the changes occurring. In this chapter, you will get an introduction to the use of LandTrendr, one of these time-series approaches used to characterize time series of spectral values.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Evaluating yearly time-series spectral values to distinguish between true change and artifacts.
 - Recognizing disturbance and growth signals in the time series of annual spectral values for individual pixels.
 - Interpreting change segments and translating them to maps.
 - Applying parameters in a graphical user interface to create disturbance maps in forests.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

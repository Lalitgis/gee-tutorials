## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F3: Advanced Image Processing

Once you understand the basics of processing images in Earth Engine, this Part will present some of the more advanced processing tools available for treating individual images. These include creating regressions among image bands, transforming images with pixel-based and neighborhood-based techniques, and grouping individual pixels into objects that can then be classified.

# Chapter F3.1: Advanced Pixel-Based Image Transformation
## Authors
Karen Dyson, Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, Nicholas Clinton, and David Saah



## Overview
Using bands and indices is often not sufficient for obtaining high-quality image classifications. This chapter introduces the idea of more complex pixel-based band manipulations that can extract more information for analysis, building on what was presented in Part F1 and Part F2. We will first learn how to manipulate images with expressions and then move on to more complex linear transformations that leverage matrix algebra.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding what linear transformations are and why pixel-based image transformations are useful.
 - Learning how to use expressions for band manipulation.
 - Being introduced to some of the most common types of linear transformations.
 - Using arrays and functions in Earth Engine to apply linear transformations to images.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

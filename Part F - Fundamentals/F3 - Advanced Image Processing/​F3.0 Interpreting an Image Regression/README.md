## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F3: Advanced Image Processing

Once you understand the basics of processing images in Earth Engine, this Part will present some of the more advanced processing tools available for treating individual images. These include creating regressions among image bands, transforming images with pixel-based and neighborhood-based techniques, and grouping individual pixels into objects that can then be classified.

# Chapter F3.0: Interpreting an Image: Regression
## Authors
Karen Dyson, Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, David Saah, Nicholas Clinton



## Overview
This chapter introduces the use of regression to interpret imagery. Regression is one of the fundamental tools you can use to move from viewing imagery to analyzing it. In the present context, regression means predicting a numeric variable for a pixel instead of a categorical variable, such as a class label.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Learning about Earth Engine reducers.
 - Understanding the difference between regression and classification.
 - Using reducers to implement regression between image bands.
 - Evaluating regression model performance visually and numerically.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F3: Advanced Image Processing

Once you understand the basics of processing images in Earth Engine, this Part will present some of the more advanced processing tools available for treating individual images. These include creating regressions among image bands, transforming images with pixel-based and neighborhood-based techniques, and grouping individual pixels into objects that can then be classified.

# Chapter F3.3: Object-Based Image Analysis
## Authors 
Morgan A. Crowley, Jeffrey Cardille, Noel Gorelick



## Overview
Pixel-based classification can include unwanted noise. Techniques for object-based image analysis are designed to detect objects within images, making classifications that can address this issue of classification noise. In this chapter, you will learn how region-growing can be used to identify objects in satellite imagery within Earth Engine. By understanding how objects can be delineated and treated in an image, students can apply this technique to their own images to produce landscape assessments with less extraneous noise. Here we treat images with an object delineator and view the results of simple classifications to view similarities and differences.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Learning about object-based image classification in Earth Engine.
 - Controlling noise in images by adjusting different aspects of object segmentation.
 - Understanding differences through time of noise in images.
 - Creating and viewing objects from different sensors.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

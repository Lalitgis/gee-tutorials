## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F6: Advanced Topics

Although you now know the most basic fundamentals of Earth Engine, there is still much more that can be done. The Part presents some advanced topics that can help expand your skill set for doing larger and more complex projects. These include tools for sharing code among users, scaling up with efficient project design, creating apps for non-expert users, and combining R with other information processing platforms.

# Chapter F6.4: Combining R and Earth Engine

## Authors 
Cesar Aybar, David Montero, Antony Barja, Fernando Herrera, Andrea Gonzales, and Wendy Espinoza



## Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce rgee, a non-official API for Earth Engine. You will explore the main features available in rgee and how to set up an environment that integrates rgee with third-party R and Python packages. After this chapter, you will be able to combine R, Python, and JavaScript in the same workflow.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Becoming familiar with rgee, the Earth Engine R API interface.
 - Integrating rgee with other R packages.
 - Displaying interactive maps.
 - Integrating Python and R packages using reticulate.
 - Combining Earth Engine JavaScript and Python APIs with R.

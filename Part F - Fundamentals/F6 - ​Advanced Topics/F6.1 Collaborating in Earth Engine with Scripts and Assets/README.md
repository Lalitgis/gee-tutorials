## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F6: Advanced Topics

Although you now know the most basic fundamentals of Earth Engine, there is still much more that can be done. The Part presents some advanced topics that can help expand your skill set for doing larger and more complex projects. These include tools for sharing code among users, scaling up with efficient project design, creating apps for non-expert users, and combining R with other information processing platforms.

# Chapter F6.1: Collaborating in Earth Engine with Scripts and Assets
## Author
Sabrina H. Szeto



## Overview
Many users find themselves needing to collaborate with others in Earth Engine at some point. Students may need to work on a group project, people from different organizations might want to collaborate on research together, or people may want to share a script or an asset they created with others. This chapter will show you how to collaborate with others and share your work.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding when it is important to share a script or asset.
 - Understanding what roles and permission options are available.

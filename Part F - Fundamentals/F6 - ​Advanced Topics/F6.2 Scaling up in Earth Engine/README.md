## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F6: Advanced Topics

Although you now know the most basic fundamentals of Earth Engine, there is still much more that can be done. The Part presents some advanced topics that can help expand your skill set for doing larger and more complex projects. These include tools for sharing code among users, scaling up with efficient project design, creating apps for non-expert users, and combining R with other information processing platforms.


# Chapter F6.2: Scaling Up in Earth Engine

## Authors
Jillian M. Deines, Stefania Di Tommaso, Nicholas Clinton, Noel Gorelick    



## Overview
Commonly, when Earth Engine users move from tutorials to developing their own processing scripts, they encounter the dreaded error messages, “computation timed out” or “user memory limit exceeded.” Computational resources are never unlimited, and the team at Earth Engine has designed a robust system with built-in checks to ensure server capacity is available to everyone. This chapter will introduce general tips for creating efficient Earth Engine workflows that accomplish users’ ambitious research objectives within the constraints of the Earth Engine ecosystem. We use two example case studies: 1) extracting a daily climate time series for many locations across two decades, and 2) generating a regional, cloud-free median composite from Sentinel-2 imagery.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding constraints on Earth Engine resource use.
 - Becoming familiar with multiple strategies to scale Earth Engine operations.
 - Managing large projects and multistage workflows.
 - Recognizing when using the Python API may be advantageous to execute large batches of tasks.

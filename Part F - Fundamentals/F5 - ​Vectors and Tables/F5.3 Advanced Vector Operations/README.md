## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F5: Vectors and Tables


In addition to raster data processing, Earth Engine supports a rich set of vector processing tools. This Part introduces you to the vector framework in Earth Engine, shows you how to create and to import your vector data, and how to combine vector and raster data for analyses.

# Chapter F5.3: Advanced Vector Operations
## Author 
Ujaval Gandhi



# Overview 
This chapter covers advanced techniques for visualizing and analyzing vector data in Earth Engine. There are many ways to visualize feature collections, and you will learn how to pick the appropriate method to create visualizations, such as a choropleth map. We will also cover geoprocessing techniques involving multiple vector layers, such as selecting features in one layer by their proximity to features in another layer and performing spatial joins.


# Learning Outcomes
 - Visualizing any vector dataset and creating a thematic map.
 - Understanding joins in Earth Engine.
 - Carrying out geoprocessing tasks with vector layers in Earth Engine.

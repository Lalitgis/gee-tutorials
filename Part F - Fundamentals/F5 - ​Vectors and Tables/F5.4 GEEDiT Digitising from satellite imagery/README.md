## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F5: Vectors and Tables


In addition to raster data processing, Earth Engine supports a rich set of vector processing tools. This Part introduces you to the vector framework in Earth Engine, shows you how to create and to import your vector data, and how to combine vector and raster data for analyses.

# Chapter F5.4: GEEDiT - Digitizing From Satellite Imagery

## Author
James Lea



## Overview 
Earth surface margins and features are often of key interest to environmental scientists. A coastline, the terminus of a glacier, the outline of a landform, and many other examples can help illustrate past, present, and potential future environmental change. The information gained from these features can be used to achieve greater understanding of the underlying processes that are controlling these systems, to monitor their responses to ongoing environmental changes, and to assess and inform wider socio-economic impacts at local to global scales.


While it is common practice in remote sensing to automate identification of margins from imagery, these attempts are not always successful or transferable between seasons or locations. Furthermore, in some circumstances the nature of the margins that need to be identified means that implementing automated approaches are not always necessary, desirable, or even possible. In such cases, user-led manual digitization of margins may be the only appropriate way to generate accurate, user-verified data. However, users who wish to undertake this analysis at scale often face the time-consuming challenge of having to download and process large volumes of satellite imagery. Furthermore, issues such as internet connection speed, local storage capacity, and computational processing power availability can potentially limit or even preclude this style of analysis, leading to a fundamental inequality in the ability of users to generate datasets of comparable standards.



The Google Earth Engine Digitisation Tool (GEEDiT) is built to allow any researcher to rapidly access satellite imagery and directly digitize margins as lines or polygons. With a simple user interface and no need to download enormous images, GEEDiT leverages Earth Engine’s cloud computing power and its access to satellite image repositories (Lea, 2018). When the delineated vector margins are exported, they are also appended with standardized metadata from the source imagery. In doing so, users can easily trace back to which images associate with which digitized margins, facilitating reproducibility, independent verification, and building of easily shareable and transferable datasets (e.g. Goliber et al. 2022). Since GEEDiT is used through a graphical user interface, it requires no coding ability in Earth Engine to use it.



GEEDiT has been used for research in glaciology (e.g., Tuckett et al. 2019; Fahrner et al. 2021), hydrology (e.g., Boothroyd et al. 2021; Scheingross et al. 2021) and lake extent (e.g., Kochtitzky et al. 2020; Field et al. 2021) in addition to other fields. Version 2 of GEEDiT was released in early 2022 with improved functionality, usability, and access to new datasets.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding how to use the GEEDiT v2 interface and export data from it.
 - Becoming aware of some of the new functionality introduced in GEEDiT v2.
 - Learning about potential options to customize GEEDiT v2 visualization parameters.

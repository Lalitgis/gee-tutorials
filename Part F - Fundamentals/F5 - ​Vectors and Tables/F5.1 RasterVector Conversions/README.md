## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F5: Vectors and Tables


In addition to raster data processing, Earth Engine supports a rich set of vector processing tools. This Part introduces you to the vector framework in Earth Engine, shows you how to create and to import your vector data, and how to combine vector and raster data for analyses.

# Chapter F5.1: Raster/Vector Conversions
## Authors
Keiko Nomura, Samuel Bowers



## Overview 
The purpose of this chapter is to review methods of converting between raster and vector data formats, and to understand the circumstances in which this is useful. By way of example, this chapter focuses on topographic elevation and forest cover change in Colombia, but note that these are generic methods that can be applied in a wide variety of situations.


## Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding raster and vector data in Earth Engine and their differing properties.
 - Knowing how and why to convert from raster to vector.
 - Knowing how and why to convert from vector to raster.
 - Write a function and map it over a FeatureCollection.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

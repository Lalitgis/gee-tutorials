## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F1: Programming and Remote Sensing Basics

<br>
In order to use Earth Engine well, you will need to develop basic skills in remote sensing and programming. The language of this book is JavaScript, and you will begin by learning how to manipulate variables using it. With that base, you’ll learn about viewing individual satellite images, viewing collections of images in Earth Engine, and how common remote sensing terms are referenced and used in Earth Engine.

# Authors
Karen Dyson, Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, David Saah, Nicholas Clinton

# Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some of the principal characteristics of remotely sensed images and how they can be examined in Earth Engine. We discuss spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and spectral resolution, along with how to access important image metadata. You will be introduced to image data from several sensors aboard various satellite platforms. At the completion of the chapter, you will be able to understand the difference between remotely sensed datasets based on these characteristics, and how to choose an appropriate dataset for your analysis based on these concepts.  


# Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.
 - Navigating the Earth Engine Console to gather information about a digital image, including resolution and other data documentation.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

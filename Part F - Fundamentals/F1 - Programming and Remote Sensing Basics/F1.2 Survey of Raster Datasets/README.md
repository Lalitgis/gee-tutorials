## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F1: Programming and Remote Sensing Basics

<br>
In order to use Earth Engine well, you will need to develop basic skills in remote sensing and programming. The language of this book is JavaScript, and you will begin by learning how to manipulate variables using it. With that base, you’ll learn about viewing individual satellite images, viewing collections of images in Earth Engine, and how common remote sensing terms are referenced and used in Earth Engine.


# Authors
Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, Karen Dyson, David Saah, Nicholas Clinton

# Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the many types of collections of images available in Google Earth Engine. These include sets of individual satellite images, pre-made composites (which merge multiple individual satellite images into one composite image), classified land use and land cover (LULC) maps, weather data, and other types of datasets. If you are new to JavaScript or programming, work through Chaps. F1.0 and F1.1 first.  


# Learning Outcomes
 - Accessing and viewing sets of images in Earth Engine.
 - Extracting single scenes from collections of images.
 - Applying visualization parameters in Earth Engine to visualize an image.

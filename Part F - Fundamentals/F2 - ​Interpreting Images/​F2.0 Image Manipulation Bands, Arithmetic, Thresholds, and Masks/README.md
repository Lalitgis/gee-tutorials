## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F2: Interpreting Images

<br>
Now that you know how images are viewed and what kinds of images exist in Earth Engine, how do we manipulate them? To gain the skills of interpreting images, you’ll work with bands, combining values to form indices and masking unwanted pixels. Then, you’ll learn some of the techniques available in Earth Engine for classifying images and interpreting the results.

# Authors
Karen Dyson, Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, David Saah, and Nicholas Clinton


# Overview
Once images have been identified in Earth Engine, they can be viewed in a wide array of band combinations for targeted purposes. For users who are already versed in remote sensing concepts, this chapter shows how to do familiar tasks on this platform; for those who are entirely new to such concepts, it introduces the idea of band combinations.


# Learning Outcomes
 - Understanding what spectral indices are and why they are useful.
 - Being introduced to a range of example spectral indices used for a variety of purposes.

# Invitation for collaborators:
Please feel free to contribute to the document. Let's try bring the spatial data science contents together so that it would be easier for every one to learn and share the knowledge. You can also provide your valuable suggestion from our contact page.

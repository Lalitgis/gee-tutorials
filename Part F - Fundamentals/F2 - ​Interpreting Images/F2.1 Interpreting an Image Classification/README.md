## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F2: Interpreting Images

<br>
Now that you know how images are viewed and what kinds of images exist in Earth Engine, how do we manipulate them? To gain the skills of interpreting images, you’ll work with bands, combining values to form indices and masking unwanted pixels. Then, you’ll learn some of the techniques available in Earth Engine for classifying images and interpreting the results.

# Overview
Image classification is a fundamental goal of remote sensing. It takes the user from viewing an image to labeling its contents. This chapter introduces readers to the concept of classification and walks users through the many options for image classification in Earth Engine. You will explore the processes of training data collection, classifier selection, classifier training, and image classification.


# Learning Outcomes
 - Running a classification in Earth Engine.
 - Understanding the difference between supervised and unsupervised classification.
 - Learning how to use Earth Engine geometry drawing tools.
 - Learning how to collect sample data in Earth Engine.
 - Learning the basics of the hexadecimal numbering system.

## Background
<br>

This is the collection of tutorials prepared by multiple individuals that were shared publicly as documents for learning purposes. These documents has been converted to web pages and are made easy aceess to the normal users via web page. The entire content of the oage are the hardwork from the authors mentioned in the page itself. We don't own it. We simply made the materials available in very easy and effective way for the users. In a manner of saying we are looking for the value addition of the existing tutorials available for the users.

<br>

The entire lab work and explanation includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

# Part F2: Interpreting Images

<br>
Now that you know how images are viewed and what kinds of images exist in Earth Engine, how do we manipulate them? To gain the skills of interpreting images, you’ll work with bands, combining values to form indices and masking unwanted pixels. Then, you’ll learn some of the techniques available in Earth Engine for classifying images and interpreting the results.

# Authors
Andréa Puzzi Nicolau, Karen Dyson, David Saah, Nicholas Clinton



# Overview
This chapter will enable you to assess the accuracy of an image classification. You will learn about different metrics and ways to quantify classification quality in Earth Engine. Upon completion, you should be able to evaluate whether your classification needs improvement and know how to proceed when it does.


# Learning Outcomes
 - Learning how to perform accuracy assessment in Earth Engine.
 - Understanding how to generate and read a confusion matrix.
 - Understanding overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient.
 - Understanding the difference between user’s and producer’s accuracy, and the difference between omission and commission errors.
